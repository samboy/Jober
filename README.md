This is a work in progress.

# Goal

The initial goal of this project is to use Lua 5.1 / [Lunacy](https://github.com/samboy/lunacy) 
to generate random Civilization 4 maps.

# License

To the extent possible, the code is public domain.

Pieces which implement the Civilization IV API may need to use pieces
of Civilization IV code to correctly make Civ4 maps.  This is allowed
under fair use law as per the Supreme Court decision in [Google v. Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.).

# Directories

* `lunacy` Source code and binary which can run the JoberGen script
* `Lib` Libraries for generating maps
* `Test` Scripts for testing JoberGen functionality
